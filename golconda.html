            Golconda Fort (initially called Golla Konda, which means Shepherds’ Hill) is a castle and early capital of the Qutb Shahi Dynasty in the western part of Hyderabad, Telangana. The Golconda includes four forts in an 11-kilometre area with eight gateways. Golconda is famous for diamond mines and produced some famous diamonds like Koh-i-Noor (now owned by the United Kingdom), Blue Hope (United States), Daria-e-Noor (Iran), etc. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Golconda is known initially as Mankal and built in 1143 by Kakatiyas (South Indian Dynasty). It is rumoured that when the Kakatiyas were building the fort, a shepherd boy found an idol of a god on the site. That is why it is called Golla Konda or the Shepherd’s Hill. Then the fort was rebuilt by Rani Rudrama Devi and her successor Prataparudra.

        <p>
            Later the fort came under the control of Kamma Nayakas, defeated the Tughlaqi army from occupying Warangal. In 1364 it was ceded to Bahamani Sultans from Kamma King Musunuri Kapaya Nayaka.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bahamani sultans slowly rose to the prominence of Golconda. Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk (1487-1543) was sent to Golconda as a Governor, established the city as the seat of government in 1501. During this period Bahamani Sultanate gradually weakened and in 1538, Sultan Quli established the Qutb Shahi Dynasty.

        <p>
            Inside the fort, there were several royal apartments, halls, temples, mosques, stables, etc. Bala Hissar Gate is the main entrance to the fort from the eastern side. The door has a painted arch bordered by rows of scrollwork. Above the door, there is a peacock with ornate tails. The design of peacocks is from Hindu architecture that underlies the Hindu origin of the fort.
